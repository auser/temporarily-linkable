TemporarilyLinkable
===================

Easy.

Just call temporarily_linkable in a model you want to add temporary links to.

Then, when you want to create a temporary link, just call
	create_temporary_link
and you've got a temporarily_linkable for the object.

Then, in your model, you have access to the method:

find_by_temporary_token to retrieve your object.

Example
=======

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
	temporarily_linkable
end

@user.create_temporary_link

# account_controller
def retrieve
	@user = User.find_by_temporary_token(params[:token])
end

You can also find the user by active temporary tokens with
  User.find_by_active_temporary_token(params[:token])

The temporary links expire after one week by default, but the plugin does not require you to handle the expiration date.

Done and done.
